# Dream Team

Welcome to DreamTeam! I built this web application because I initially wanted to share my love for NBA basketball with my non-basketball-watching "friends." I was drawn into basketball because I was invited to a NBA fantasy league tournament. There was a huge learning curve, so I wanted to build a simpler version that would be more beginner friendly. I wanted to create a more personal and casual-friendly experience for people who are not huge fans of the NBA to get them more engaged in the game. Whether you've never seen a basketball game before or you're a die-hard NBA fan all your life, I hope you enjoy playing around with this application and build your Dream Team. :)

## Technologies

I built this project using HTML/CSS, Bootstrap CSS library, and client-side JavaScript for my front-end, PHP for my back-end, and SQL and MySQL for my database. DreamTeam features CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete) functionality, session/sookies, CSS/JS animations,  different user permission levels (registered users, guest users), and REST (Server-Side) APIs.

I used the NBA API: http://nbasense.com/nba-api/ to retrieve the most up-to-date league team standings and statistics.
